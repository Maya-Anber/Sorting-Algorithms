# Sorting-Algorithms

### Sorting Techniques Comparison

## Objective
This program compares three sorting techniques: Linear Sort, Bubble Sort, and Quick Sort. The comparison is made for different types of arrays (Random, Sorted, and Inversely Sorted) and for various array sizes (up to 10,000 elements). The program evaluates these techniques based on:
- Relative run time
- Number of comparisons
- Number of interchanges of entries

## Features
The program provides the following functionalities:
1. Generate arrays of different types (sorted, inversely sorted, or random)
or accept input containing lists of integers of different sizes separated by a space.
3. Implement Linear Sort, Bubble Sort, and Quick Sort algorithms.
4. Compare the sorting techniques based on:
   - Relative run time
   - Number of comparisons
   - Number of interchanges of entries
5. Display the results of the comparison in:
   - A table
   - A graph
6. Simulate the sorting iterations with a visual representation of the sorting process.

## Instructions

### Generating and Inputting Arrays
- The program can generate arrays of a specific type:
  - Random
  - Sorted
  - Inversely Sorted
- Alternatively, the program can accept user input. 

### Sorting Techniques
1. **Linear Sort**
2. **Bubble Sort**
3. **Quick Sort**

### Expected Output
The program outputs:
- A table representing the comparison results for the three sorting techniques across different array sizes.
- A graph representing these results.
- A simulation of sorting iterations, visualizing the positions of numbers (represented as lines or bars) changing at each iteration.
